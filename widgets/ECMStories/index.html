Initially the member was not following up with their medical appointments. The LCM worked with the KHS ECM Advocate and they both looked into available resources. They were able to assist this member in getting approved for medically tailored meals through Community Supports Services (CSS). Shortly thereafter, someone stole the member’s prosthetic leg and the member expressed hopelessness and devastation. The LCM then requested an electric wheelchair and a replacement for the prosthetic leg, both were approved. The LCM and KHS Advocate also assisted in finding a home for this member. The member is now interacting with everyone at the ECM Site, engaging with LCM and following up on all appointments. This member was initially blind but had a successful surgery to restore their vision. The member was very excited to meet the KHS ECM Advocate in person. During the meeting, the member was tearful, thanking the team for helping them.`,
