The LCM was able to help the member obtain medical baseline eligibility with PG&E. This member is now attending medical appointments, adhering to ECM, and compliance with the program. The member started Behavioral Health (BH) sessions and after receiving the initial assistance, was open to starting therapy sessions again. Recently, the LCM was able to enroll the member’s significant other in the program. Member has significantly improved since starting the ECM program.`,

The LCM was able to seek eye care and assisted member in scheduling an appointment for eye surgery. The member also has a dog; they were able to help this member register the dog as the member’s service animal so the dog can help the member with their anxiety and depression. The LCM advises member was able to get their eye surgery and was able to connect with a cousin. That cousin helped to house the member. The LCM was also able to help out with an SSI application, so this member can receive help financially moving forward.`,

Initially the member was not following up with their medical appointments. The LCM worked with the KHS ECM Advocate and they both looked into available resources. They were able to assist this member in getting approved for medically tailored meals through Community Supports Services (CSS). Shortly thereafter, someone stole the member’s prosthetic leg and the member expressed hopelessness and devastation. The LCM then requested an electric wheelchair and a replacement for the prosthetic leg, both were approved. The LCM and KHS Advocate also assisted in finding a home for this member. The member is now interacting with everyone at the ECM Site, engaging with LCM and following up on all appointments. This member was initially blind but had a successful surgery to restore their vision. The member was very excited to meet the KHS ECM Advocate in person. During the meeting, the member was tearful, thanking the team for helping them.`,
